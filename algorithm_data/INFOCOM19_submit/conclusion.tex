\section{Conclusion}

On top of the original INT primitive, we propose \emph{INT-path}, a network-wide telemetry framework/system that includes a source routing-based path monitoring mechanism and an Euler trail-based path planning policy. The mechanism allows user-specified path monitoring while the policy can \emph{optimally} generate non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire network. Our approach can ``encode'' the network-wide traffic status into a series of ``bitmap images'', making traffic analysis as straightforward as image pattern recognition.
