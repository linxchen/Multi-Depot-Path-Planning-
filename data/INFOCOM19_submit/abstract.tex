With the ever-increasing complexity of networks, fine-grained network monitoring enables better network reliability and timely feedback control. The In-band Network Telemetry (INT) allows cost-effective network monitoring by encapsulating device-internal states into probe packets. However, INT only specifies an underlying device-level primitive while how to achieve \emph{network-wide} traffic monitoring remains undefined. In this work, we propose \emph{INT-path}, a network-wide telemetry \emph{framework}, by decoupling the system into a routing mechanism and a routing path generation policy. Specifically, we embed \emph{source routing} into INT probes to allow specifying the route the probe packet takes through the network. Above the mechanism, we develop an \emph{Euler trail-based} path planning policy to generate \emph{non-overlapped} INT paths that cover the entire network with a \emph{minimum} path number and give an exhaustive analysis of algorithm's run-time complexity. INT-path can ``encode'' the network-wide traffic status into a series of ``bitmap images'', transforming network troubleshooting into well-studied pattern recognition problems. INT-path is very suitable for deployment in data center networks thanks to their symmetry network topologies.
